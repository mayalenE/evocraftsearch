<p>The idea of the <a href="https://evocraft.life/">Minecraft Open-Endedness Challenge</a> is to try and think how would we artificially approach <em>“open-endedness”</em> in the Minecraft environment, 
put in another words it asks the question: <em>Can build an artificial system that would be able to generate endless surprises if runned “forever” in Minecraft?</em><br />
While there is not a single path toward solving that <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/">grand challenge you’ve never heard of</a>, 
this article explains our views on the subject and what we believe to be some working ingredients for the endless generation of novel increasingly complex artifacts in Minecraft.</p>

<h2 id="problem-formulation">Problem Formulation</h2>
<hr />

<p>Minecraft game environnement $E$ is made of $1m^3$ building blocks that players can use to construct any structure they desire (also called <em>artifacts</em>) with almost endless possibilities to express their creativity.
The blocks exist in a spatio-temporal world which is 3-dimensional in space and where time advances with each gametick.
There is a finite number of possible blocks (M=255) which are described by their <em>type</em> $m$ (eg: water, wood, air, etc.) and optionally by a <em>state</em> $s$ which further describes the block appearance 
(eg: texture, orientation) or behavior (eg: age, on/off state, counters).</p>

<p>Let’s define the <em>spaces</em> of our problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>State space $\Sigma$</strong>: each “cell” of the world (x,y,z) can take a certain state $s^t$. The <em>visible</em> state in the Evocraft API world is limited to the block type $j \in \{1..M\}$. 
However nothing prevents us to consider state spaces with higher representational capacity, for instance by attaching an <em>hidden</em> feature vector $h \in \mathbb{R^d}$ to each “cell” of the world. 
The state could describe concrete physical attributes of the cell at this point in space in time (eg: mass or electric currant) as well as more abstract quantities used for computation by the rules of our generator (eg: memory units).</li>
  <li><strong>Artifact space $A$</strong>: an <em>artifact</em> $a$ in Minecraft (also called <em>phenotype</em>) is described as a set $\{(m, x, y, z, t, s)\}$ of elemental blocks where $m$ is the block type; 
$(x,y,z)$ is the spatial position; $t$ is the timestep; and $s$ is the block state.
In the rest, an artifact is represented by its discrete time serie $a = \{a^0, \dots, a^t, \dots\}$ (with $a^t=a^0$ for static artifacts).</li>
  <li><strong>Search space $\Theta$</strong>: each artifact is the result of some sort of <em>design</em> or <em>generative</em> process where
a <em>genome</em> $\theta$ determines the artifact initial state $a^0$ as well as the artifact development over time $(a^0, \dots, a^t) \rightarrow a^{t+1}$.
The choice of the genome $\theta$ and of the generative process $G: \Theta \rightarrow A$ (also called <em>genotype-to-phenotype</em> mapping) will define the search space $\Theta$ and the 
reachable artifact space $A$ of our system.</li>
  <li><strong>Solution space $W$</strong>: the solution space is set of all possible <em>artifacts</em> $\{a \in E\}$ which can be generated by $G$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following that formalism, our open-ended framework is composed of two main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an <strong>artifact-generator $G: \Theta \rightarrow A$</strong> which should allow for artifacts with unbounded phenotypic complexity.</li>
  <li>an <strong>artifact-discovery $D$</strong> algorithm that evolves a set of genomes and their corresponding artifacts $\{(\theta_1, a_1=G(\theta_1)), \dots, (\theta_N, a_N=G(\theta_N))\} \in W$<br />
($N \to \infty$ in the open-ended setting) and that should ceasessly evolve novel and increasingly complex artifacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to artificially construct the genome $\theta$, the genotype-to-phenotype mapping $G$ and to how to evolve sets of artifacts $\{(\theta,a)\} \in W$ complying with open-ended problems remains an open question to date.
However, interdisciplinary research at the crossroad of complex system science, machine learning and biology seem to suggest a list of necessary “ingredients” that such a system 
should comply with to have the hope of exhibiting a high level of open-ended dynamics [<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/">Stanley et al., 2020</a>].
In the next section, we present what we believe to be <em>desirata</em> properties to include in our open-ended framework; and in the following section we propose a <em>possible</em> implementations of those ideas in the Minecraft environment.</p>

<h2 id="desirata-properties-of-our-open-ended-framework">Desirata Properties of our Open-Ended Framework</h2>

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #828282; max-width: 840px; margin-top: -25px; margin-left:0;" />

<p><strong>Complex systems</strong> are good candidates of processes that can produce unbounded growth in complexity, where the complexity is generated from the cooperation of
many entities that interact with each other and with the environment in a recursive nonlinear way.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/artifact-generator/generator.png" style="zoom: 0.7; margin-left: 200px;" /></p>

<p>We formulate our <em>artifact-generator</em> $G$ as an artificial complex system which should comply with the following general properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dynamical system —</strong> $G$ recursively applies an update rule $f$ that changes the state of the system over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Growth —</strong> the inititial state $a^0$ is limited in space and complexity and the phenotype grows and complexifies over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Local interactions —</strong> the update rule $f$ is defined on a local neighborhood ball and <em>shared</em> at the different locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-linearity —</strong> $G$ has non-linear dynamics $f$.</li>
  <li>(may be) <strong>Open —</strong> exchanging flows of matter/energy with their environment allows system to exhibit high levels of diversity, heterogeneity and complexity.</li>
  <li>(may have a) <strong>Memory —</strong> the state of the system might depend on its history.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="d-meta-diversity-search-for-the-endless-discovery-of-novel-artifacts">$D$: meta-diversity search for the endless discovery of novel artifacts</h3>
<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #828282; max-width: 780px; margin-top: -25px; margin-left:0;" />

<p>Implementing computational systems with the above properties and artificial worlds that exhibit life-like behaviors similar to those of natural complex system, is not new 
(goes back to von Neumann’s seminal work on cellular automata in the 40’s) nor that far from reach (it is one of the core thematics of the <em>Artificial Life</em> research discipline). 
As an example, John Conway’s <a href="">Game of Life</a> is a well-known artificial complex system from the 70’s that is very easy to implement and yet that can generate a very wide range of life-like structures and dynamics.
However, a more challenging question is <em>how to automate the long-term discovery of increasingly complex and divergent structures in such systems</em>.
As an illustration of those challenges, more than 50 years after the creation of Conway’s game of life, people are still discovering novel highly-complex patterns which remained unknown to date.</p>

<p>In the same way that Conway’s Game of Life together with the community of people searching might form an example of open-ended system,
our framework needs to couple the artifact-generator $G$ with a discovery algorithm $D$ able to continuously search for novel possible artifacts.</p>

<p>The exploration of artificial like the Game of Life have mainly been done “by hand”, relying on the human eye to determine what an interesting pattern is.
Methods that propose to <em>automatically</em> explore the input space $\Theta$ of complex systems can be divided in 3 main families:
<em>“naive”</em> strategies (independant of the outcomes of the system), <em>optimization-driven</em> strategies and <em>diversity-driven</em> strategies.
We briefly review why these approaches (in their standard definition) are limited to comply with open-ended problems and rather tend to converge toward a sub-region of the possible solution space $W$.
Our <em>artifact-discovery</em> algorithm $D$ search objective is formulated as the <em>meta-diversity</em> objective, an extension of the standard <em>diversity</em> objective that we proposed recently
in the context of (open-ended) automated discovery in complex systems [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01195.pdf">Etcheverry et al. 2020</a>].</p>

<h4 id="naive-search-strategy">Naive search strategy</h4>
<p><img src="assets/media/artifact-discovery/naive.png" style="zoom: 0.5; float: left; margin-right: 40px;" />
An “naive” strategy consists of covering at best the known search space $\Theta$, 
for instance with <em>grid-search</em> or <em>uniform</em> sampling strategy $D: \theta \sim U(\Theta)$.
While easy to implement, this is often very inefficient in covering the space of possible phenotypes, especially for complex genotype-to-phenotype developmental mappings
where big regions of the input space $\Theta$ are mapped to small regions in the outcome space $A$ (we talk of “attractor” states).</p>

<h4 id="optimization-search-strategy">Optimization search strategy</h4>
<p><img src="assets/media/artifact-discovery/optim.png" style="zoom: 0.5; float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
Pure objective-driven search is another widely-used discovery strategy $D$, where each discovery $a$ gets scored with a fitness function $F$ and where $D$ aims to find individuals 
$\{(\theta_i, a_i)\}$ with the highest fitness scores $F(a_i)$.
Different objective-driven techniques have been implemented as discovery tool in complex systems such as evolutionary population-based search strategies [<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article/22/1/76/2838/Evolutionary-Growth-of-Genome-Representations-on">Nichele 2016</a>], 
gradient-based search strategies (if the generator $G$ and the fitness $F$ are differentiable) [<a href="https://distill.pub/2020/selforg/">Mordvintsev et al. 2020</a>], 
and reinforcement learning strategies (if the system’s dynamics $f$ integrates a differentiable policy which actions influence the system next state) [<a href="https://pathak22.github.io/modular-assemblies/">Pathak et al. 2019</a>]. 
While these techniques can be very powerful optimizers toward desired artifacts [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08737.pdf">Sudhakaran et al. 2021</a>], they tend to converge toward “peaks” regions on the artifact fitness landscape and stop here once reached,
making them poor-fit for open-ended problems. Moreover, they generally suffer from deceptive rewards and are hardly generalizable to complex artifact spaces with limited predictability.</p>

<h4 id="diversity-search-strategy">Diversity search strategy</h4>
<p><img src="assets/media/artifact-discovery/diversity.png" style="zoom: 0.5; float: left; margin-right: 40px;" />
Another family of approaches proposes to maximize the <em>novelty</em> of the discovered phenotypes instead of the <em>fitness</em>, and leverage population-based
evolutionary and developmental curiosity-driven exploration methods like <a href="">Novelty Search</a>, <a href="">Quality-Diversity</a> or <a href="">Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes</a>.
Getting rid of the efficiency objective has shown to be effective at creating behavioral <em>diversity</em> in complex systems and a promising discovery tool [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06663">Reinke et al. 2020</a>]. 
Moreover, diversity-search can be coupled with optimization-based strategies to generate a set of diverse high-performing phenotype solutions to a problem [cite]. 
Yet standard approaches assume that the intuitive notion of diversity can be captured within a single representation space, 
which is generally called $BC$ for behavioral characterization. This limits the scope of the final discoveries: in the same way that the fitness function $f$ is constraining the reached 
area in the observation space $A$, being diverse in a specific $BC$ does not mean being diverse in $A$. 
Actually, there is not such thing as a unique ground truth “interesting” diversity in complex phenotypic spaces,
and operating in a monolithic BC space might lead to discoveries that are highly-diverse in that space but poorly-diverse
according to other potentially-interesting behavioral criteria [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01195.pdf">Etcheverry et al. 2020</a>].</p>

<h4 id="meta-diversity-search-strategy">Meta-Diversity search strategy</h4>
<p><img src="assets/media/artifact-discovery/meta-diversity.png" style="zoom: 0.5; float: left; margin-right: 40px;" />
To address these limits, we recently formulated the problem of meta-diversity search where an artificial “discovery assistant” incrementally 
(i) learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors in an <strong>outer loop</strong>
and (ii) searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them in an <strong>inner loop</strong>.
The objective of this process is to enable continuous seeking of novel niches of diversities (growing encoding capacity to characterize newly-discovered niches into <strong>divergent feature spaces</strong>)
while being able to quickly adapt the search toward a new unknown type of diversity (<strong>knowledge accumulator</strong> that leverages the diverse BCs).
Similarly, <em>quality-guidance</em> can be integrated in the framework: with minimal external feedback, a successful discovery assistant should be able to efficiently specialize 
the exploration strategy toward a particular type of “interesting” diversity,  corresponding to the initially unknown preferences of an end-user and
expressed through simple sparse feedback.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-implementation">Proposed Implementation</h2>
<hr />

<p>We simulate an artificial “chemistry” system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05433">Chan 2019</a>, <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2020/32/221/98400">Chan 2020</a>]
and an artificial “discovery assistant” (HOLMES) which integrates a goal-based intrinsically-motivated exploration
(<em>inner loop</em>’s diversity search) with the incremental learning of a growing hierarchy of behavioral characterization spaces (<em>outer loop</em>’s divergent knowledge accumulator)
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01195.pdf">Etcheverry et al. 2020</a>].</p>

<p>While abstracting away from natural chemistry, we follow this metaphore to illustrate our open-ended system and implementation choices for the challenge.</p>

<hr style="border-top: 1px solid #828282; margin-top: -25px; max-width: 600px; margin-left:0;" />

<p>CAs have been extensively studied for understanding how simple local rules can give rise to complex patterns and dynamics of the collectives.</p>

<p><img src="assets/media/LeniaChem/leniaChem.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 40px;" />
We use a continuous CA as our toy artificial chemistry system, where the CA’s 3D grid $a^t$ represents the “petri-dish” where evolved patterns will develop in time.<br />
The state space $\Sigma$ is represented with a multi-channel continuous array $A$ where each channel $A_j$ represent the “chemical potential” of the associated specy $j \in \{1..M\}$.<br />
The hyper-parameters constraining the range of possible patterns are the grid-size $(S_X, S_Y, S_Z)$ (dimensions of the “petri-dish”) and 
the number of channels $M$ (number of “chemical species” represented with blocks in Minecraft). The grid here is a torus, meaning that voxels on the top borders are neighbors to bottom voxels and same for left and right borders.</p>

<div style="display: flex;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
    <b> Parameters $\psi$ that determine $A^{t=0}$: </b>
    <ul>
    <li> a binary vector $I$ of shape $M$ which determines which channel get initialized (i.e. non-empty mass at t=0)  </li>
    <li> Each initially-present channel $j$ ($I_j=1$) is described with:
        <ul>
        <li> its <em>occupation ratio</em>: portion of the grid where it is present at t=0 </li>
        <li> its <em>cppn genome</em> which is used to generate the initial pattern $A_j^{t=0}$ </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    </ul>    
    </div>
    <div style="flex: 1.5;">
    <b> Parameters $\phi$ of the CA's update rule $f$: </b>
    <ul>
    <li> a binary vector $C$ of shape $M^2$ which determines which species are interacting together </li>
    <li> Each interacting channel pair $(c_i,c_j)$ ($C_{i \rightarrow j}=1$) is described with:
        <ul>
        <li> fraction $h$ of the update applied per time step (intra-specy rate of growth) </li>
        <li> the kernel $K$ with:
            <ul>
            <li> the kernel size $R_x, R_y, R_z$ (<em>neighborhood</em> size) </li>
            <li> the <em>cppn genome</em> which generates the kernel matrix $K$ </li> </ul> 
        </li>
        <li> the <em>growth function</em> mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$ </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li> fraction $dt$ of the growth update applied per time step (global rate of growth) </li>
    </ul>

<p><img src="assets/media/LeniaChem/cronin_dropfactory.gif" style="zoom: 0.4; float: right; margin-left: 30px;" />
Following the “artificial chemistry” metaphore, we can imagine the parameters $\theta = (\psi, \phi)$ as representing the quantity and disposition of each starting material 
as well as the operating conditions (temperature, pressure, pH, etc.) influencing the development of the final product.
As an example, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/5/eaay4237">Grizou et al. 2020</a> recently propose to explore the dynamics of an oil-droplet system with a “curious robot” which could manipulate the initial mixture composition of chemicals.<br />
The resulting “artifact” here would be the yield of each compound in the final product, the rest being considered as empty “air” invisible blocks in Minecraft.</p>

<p>The <strong>“physics” formulas $f$</strong> of our petri-dish follow Lenia rules [<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2020/32/221/98400">Chan 2020</a>] 
and apply the following updates to the state at each time step:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Loop on all kernel $K_{i \rightarrow j}$ and:
    <ol>
      <li>calculate the weighted sums $K_{i \rightarrow j} * A_i$ with its source channel $A_i$</li>
      <li>Apply growth mapping to the weighted sums: $G_{i \rightarrow j} =\sum 2 \times e^{-\frac{\left((K_{i \rightarrow j} * A_i) - \mu\right)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} - 1$</li>
      <li>Add a small relative portion $dt * h_{i \rightarrow j}$ of the resulting growth to the destination channel: <script type="math/tex">A_j \mathrel{+}= dt * h_{i \rightarrow j} * G_{i \rightarrow j}</script></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The potentials of each channels $A_j$ are clipped between 0 and 1</li>
  <li>To prevent participation of empty “air” cells in the update process we apply an alive-masking step [<a href="https://distill.pub/2020/selforg/">Mordvintsev et al. 2020</a>] as follows: we fix the air potential (channel 0) to a fixed value 0.1 and we consider
empty every location which maximum potential is lower than 0.1, by setting every channels (except air’s one) to 0.</li>
  <li>Finally chemical “matter” is created in zones of higher chemical potential with $a^t = \underset{j \in M}{argmax} A^t$</li>
</ol>
